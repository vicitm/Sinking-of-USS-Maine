          On February 15, 1898, the USS Maine, an American battleship, exploded
          and sank in Havana Harbor, Cuba, killing 266 sailors. The incident
          sparked outrage in the United States and led to the outbreak of the
          Spanish-American War. The exact cause of the explosion remains a
          mystery, but it is believed to have been either an external mine or an
          internal fire. Regardless of the cause, the sinking of the Maine
          played a significant role in shaping American foreign policy and
          marked a turning point in the nation's history.

        <p>
          At the time of the sinking of the Maine, Cuba was in the midst of a
          prolonged and bloody rebellion against Spanish colonial rule. The
          United States had a long history of involvement in Cuban affairs, and
          many Americans sympathized with the Cuban rebels. In January 1898,
          President William McKinley sent the USS Maine to Havana Harbor to
          protect American interests and show support for the Cuban peopl

        <h2>Impact of the Sinking of USS Maine</h2>
        <p>
          The sinking of the USS Maine in 1898 had profound consequences, both
          in terms of its immediate aftermath and the broader historical
          context.
        </p>
        <p>
          The event heightened tensions between the United States and Spain,
          ultimately leading to the outbreak of the Spanish-American War. The
          war, fueled by public anger and the rallying cry "Remember the Maine,"
          resulted in a decisive American victory and marked the end of Spain's
          colonial empire.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yellow journalism played a significant role in shaping public opinion
          and pushing the nation towards war. The sensationalized reporting by
          newspapers, particularly those owned by William Randolph Hearst and
          Joseph Pulitzer, contributed to the fervor and desire for retaliation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sinking of the Maine, whether caused by an internal explosion or
          an external mine, became a symbol of American resolve and a catalyst
          for military action. The war that ensued had far-reaching geopolitical
          implications, solidifying the United States as a major player on the
          world stage.
